	<h1>WAYA</h1>
	<p>Forgiving the name of a friend's wife or child can be really embarrassing. WAYA (Who Are
	You, Again) is a software to help you avoid this situation. With WAYA you can take notes
	on your friends, colleagues and people you hold dear, to avoid having to rely on your (bad)
	memory.</p>
	
	<h1>Graphical interface</h1>
	<h2>Content of the interface</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Left: List of the persons</li>
		<li>Left-bottom: category filter, to  only display persons from a specific category in the list</li>
